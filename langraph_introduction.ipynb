      "Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that possess characteristics or capabilities typically associated with autonomous agents. These systems are designed to perform tasks with some level of independence, adaptability, and decision-making ability, often in dynamic and complex environments. Let's break down the concept in detail:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Characteristics of Agentic AI\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Autonomy**:\n",
      "   - Agentic AI systems can operate without human intervention for extended periods. This autonomy allows them to make decisions and take actions based on their programming and the data they receive from their environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proactivity**:\n",
      "   - These AI systems not only react to changes in their environment but are capable of taking initiative. They can anticipate future states and act in a way that aligns with predefined goals or objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Perception and Understanding**:\n",
      "   - Agentic AI can perceive its environment through sensors or data inputs and process this information to understand the context. This might involve visual data, auditory inputs, or other sensor-based information processing.\n",
      "\n",

And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.\",\n",

But financing remains difficult for small business owners across the country.',\n",
       " \"So tonight, I'm proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat.
